## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


Lab 4
Lab 4 stood out as one of my favorites because it combined practical math conversions with aguessing game. In Part 1, converting milliliters to U.S. customary units was fun because it gave me a real-world context for understanding functions and how calculations can be done. I learned how to define and call functions effectively, which improved my understanding of program structure and reusability. In Part 2, the high/low guessing game was both fun and challenging. It gave me hands-on practice with conditional statements (if/else) and logic design. The need to guide the player with hints like "Too high" or "Too low" helped me think about user experience.

Lab 6
Lab 6 was one of my favorite labs because it was both practical and creative. This exercise helped me understand how command-line arguments can be used to pass information into a program. Additionally, the requirement to validate user input taught me the importance of error handling and ensuring a program runs smoothly even with unexpected inputs.

Lab 9
I enjoyed the secret number game because it demonstrated the importance of separating functionalities into distinct programs, one for setting a secret and the other for guessing. I learned how to write and read data from files using std::ofstream and std::ifstream, which helped me understand data storage. Debugging the program to handle malformed inputs and edge cases taught me how to improve the robustness of my code.
